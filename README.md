# Proximity Based Authnetication
## Summary
The Proximity-based Authentication project, developed as part of the Mobile Computing course, implements a system that uses Radio Frequency (RF) signals to authenticate users based on their proximity to a device. By employing Arduino boards and NRF24L01 transceivers, the project explores various approaches to ensure both the authenticity of the transmitted signals and the accurate detection of the user's distance. The system aims to provide secure and efficient proximity-based authentication, with potential applications in IoT devices and mobile systems, while addressing challenges such as signal interference and integration complexity.
